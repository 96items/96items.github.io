                <p class="text-faded">TradeMon Bot sends simple alerts on major currency rates, crypt currencies, stock indices, oil quotes and precious metals. The function is designed mainly for private investors who trade during the day with investment products that require constant monitoring of rates. Through the Telegram messenger in the TradeMon application, the user only needs to select a product (i.e. EUR/USD), the direction of speculation (rate movement up - "buy", rate movement down - "sell") and levels of acceptable profit or loss, for example, stop loss 20bp, stop profit 40bp. TradeMon informs the investor from the moment of entering the data on reaching these set parameters, as well as exceeding them by a multiple of times (i.e. stop profit 40, 80, 120 bp, etc.). In addition, TradeMon can inform the investor about amplitude jumps in the rate, the alignment of the rate within a given range, as well as the reversal of the rate movement depending on the predefined time period. Each message through Telegram is accompanied by a graphical display of intra-day rate movements.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">If you are currently unable to track your investments or potential investments, are busy doing other things, or are travelling, TradeMon informs you in a timely manner about the products you invested or are going to invest and the parameters you have entered. You make a decision on time, close or open a position at that moment as it is convenient for you, via smartphone, computer or by phone with your bank. To disable receiving messages from TradeMon, simply close the "virtual position" by clicking "close" for an individual instrument or your entire portfolio. </p>
                <p class="text-faded">Moreover, TradeMon offers its users the opportunity to get acquainted with and communicate in Telegram Chats.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">Let`s go! Open and close your positions on time, buy on the bottom, sell on the peak!</p>
